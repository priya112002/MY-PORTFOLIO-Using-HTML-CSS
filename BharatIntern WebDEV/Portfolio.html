            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Hello!, I am K V Priyanka Varma, a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidhyapeetham, Chennai. </p>
            
              <p>  I recently completed the Cyber Security Management Virtual Experience Program offered by ANZ, 
                where I focused on Social Engineering and Digital Investigations.</p>

                <p> In my academic journey, I've worked on many projects especially in Machine Learning, IoT, and Cyber Security. 
                    Notably, I developed Gender Classification using MongoDB and Machine Learning, a Plantation Monitoring System based on IoT, 
                    and Insider Threat Detection of Ransomware using AutoML, presented at an International Conference.</p>
                
               <p> I also hold a certification in Cloud Computing from Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 
                I actively engage in technical and non-technical events, 
                refining my skills in task management and meeting deadlines.</p>
              <p>  
                Cybersecurity with AI intrigues me, and I'm committed to making the digital world more secure.

                <h3>Gender Classification using MongoDB and Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Developed a gender classification system using facial features and ML models.
                    Leveraged MongoDB for efficient data storage and management.
                    Achieved high accuracy in gender classification and continuously improved system performance.

                <h3>Insider Threat Detection of Ransomware using Automated Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Implemented Auto-ML techniques to develop a robust insider threat detection system for identifying and mitigating risks associated with ransomware attacks.
                    Analyzed data of different users and systems around 1,15,200 entries which are attacked by Ransomware. Found and classified the systems attacked by ransomware.
                    Tested the system for accuracy and reliability, achieving an accuracy rate of over 99.95 percent.

                <h3>Plantation Monitoring System based on IoT</h3>
                <p>
                    Designed and implemented a plantation monitoring system using NodeMCU microcontroller and Blink Application.
                    Developed a web-based interface and mobile application for real-time access to environmental data (humidity, temperature, moisture) collected from sensor nodes.
                    Successfully deployed the system in a real-world plantation, providing valuable insights for efficient plantation management and resource allocation.
